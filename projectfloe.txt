-------------------------Setting up project structure---------------------------

1. Create repo, clone it in local
2. Create a virtual environment named 'atlas' - conda create -n atlas python=3.10
3. Activate the virtual environment - conda activate atlas
4. pip install cookiecutter
5. cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science
6. Rename src.models -> src.model
7. git add - commit - push

-------------------------Setup MLFlow on Dagshub---------------------------
8. Go to: https://dagshub.com/dashboard
9. Create > New Repo > Connect a repo > (Github) Connect > Select your repo > Connect
10. Copy experiment tracking url and code snippet. (Also try: Go To MLFlow UI)
11. pip install dagshub & mlflow

12. Run the exp notebooks
13. git add - commit - push

14. dvc init
65. Verify the service is running: sudo systemctl status grafana-server

66. Open Grafana web UI: http://<ec2-public-ip>:3000 (username/pass - admin)

67. Add Prometheus as a Data Source: http://54.81.71.206/:9090
    click - Save and Test | Get started with building dashboards.

AWS Resource Cleanup:

* Delete deployment - kubectl delete deployment flask-app
* Delete service - kubectl delete service flask-app-service
* Delete env var - kubectl delete secret capstone-secret
* Delete EKS Cluster - eksctl delete cluster --name flask-app-cluster --region us-east-1
* Verify Cluster Deletion - eksctl get cluster --region us-east-1
* Delete artifacts of ECR and S3 (optional - delete ECR and S3)
* Validate if Cloud Formation stacks are deleted.
* Confirm service termination on AWS support chat.

***** How Is CloudFormation Related to EKS? *****

What Is CloudFormation? 
AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps define and provision AWS infrastructure as code using templates. It automates the process of creating and managing AWS resources.

How Does It Relate to EKS?
When you run eksctl, it generates CloudFormation templates behind the scenes to create:
1. The EKS control plane.
2. Node groups.
CloudFormation ensures that these resources are created and managed as a stack (a logical grouping of resources).

What Is a Stack in CloudFormation?
A CloudFormation Stack is a collection of AWS resources (like VPCs, subnets, EC2 instances, etc.) managed as a single unit. For EKS:
1. eksctl-flask-app-cluster-cluster stack: Creates the EKS control plane.
2. eksctl-flask-app-cluster-nodegroup-flask-app-nodes stack: Creates the worker nodes.

Each stack contains:

1. A template defining the resources (YAML or JSON).
2. Resource dependencies and configurations.

Fleet Requests
Definition: A Fleet Request is an AWS internal process for provisioning EC2 instances. When creating a NodeGroup, EKS uses an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to request EC2 instances, which count as Fleet Requests.

Why Relevant?: AWS imposes a limit on the number of Fleet Requests per account. If your account exceeds this limit (e.g., due to other active ASGs or EKS clusters), NodeGroup creation fails with the error "Youâ€™ve reached your quota for maximum Fleet Requests".

What is a PVC?
1. PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) is a request for storage by a Kubernetes application. It is bound to a PV (PersistentVolume), which is the actual storage resource.
2. PVCs use StorageClasses to define how the volume should be provisioned (e.g., EBS volumes on AWS, NFS, etc.).
3. When a pod is deployed and needs storage, it will request the storage defined in the PVC.
